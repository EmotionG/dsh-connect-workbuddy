  'row.desc': 'Use WorkBuddy models in DSH: each refresh reads every model\'s credit multiplier from the upstream catalog, image input is toggled per model, several accounts can be switched or failed over automatically, and daily check-in plus your remaining credits are one click away. The domestic and international sides are two independent providers, each with its own account — use both at the same time.',
  'row.expand': 'Expand',

  'row.tabCn': 'Domestic',
  'row.tabGlobal': 'Global',
  'row.tabHint': 'Each tab is a separate provider (workbuddy / workbuddy-global) with its own account, credits, and models. Both sides are live at once: different sessions can pick from either side, and changes on one tab never touch the other.',
  // The free (×0) models are NOT unlimited — they carry a per-WINDOW token quota
  // (the upstream's 6004/14003 refusals are that quota, not a billing balance).
  // Stated separately from `tabHint` and in bold because the misreading it
  // prevents is expensive: a user who believes ×0 means unlimited reads a 6004
  // as "the plugin is broken" instead of "this window's allowance is spent".
  'row.tabFreeQuotaWarn': 'Free models have a per-window token quota — they are not unlimited.',
  'row.tabSwitchHint': 'Uncheck to switch this provider off. Its models disappear from the DSH model picker; your account, credits, and model settings are kept and return when you check it again.',

  'row.tabOffNotice': 'This provider is switched off: none of its models are offered to DSH. Your account, credits, and model settings are kept — check the box above the tab to bring it back.',

  'row.signedOutWrongRegion': 'Your WorkBuddy sign-in was found, but it belongs to the other region tab. Switch tabs above to use it — there is nothing to sign in again.',
  'row.signedOutEncrypted': 'Your WorkBuddy sign-in is present, but its token fields are encrypted and the plugin could not read the key. Install the WorkBuddy desktop app, or set WORKBUDDY_APP_EXECUTABLE to its executable — signing in again will not change this.',

  'row.poolOrderRulesTitle': '本池如何挑选账号',
  'row.poolOrderRulesIntro': '池子总是先挑「现在确实能扣费的」账号。下面这些规则按顺序逐条比较，第一条分出胜负就停止，后面的只在平局时才看。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleUsable': '1. 现在能扣费吗？被限流、积分耗尽、凭证被拒或调用失败的账号会被挪到后面，直到冷却结束。这一条优先级最高，压过下面的手动顺序。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleExpiring': '2. 有 3 天内会过期的积分吗？有就排前面。这一条同样压过手动顺序，原因见下方说明。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleManual': '3. 你排的手动顺序。就是用 ↑ / ↓ 设定的位置。没有手动排过的账号，会排在所有已排序账号之后。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleNearestExpiry': '4. 谁先过期？两个都有临期积分时，先到期的排前面。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleExpiringAmount': '5. 过期多少？同样是两个都有临期积分时，临期数额大的排前面。没有临期积分时，这一步等同于比较总积分。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleTotal': '6. 总积分。积分多的排前面，接近耗尽的号先留着备用。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleFreshness': '7. 登录凭证新旧。凭证签发更晚的赢下平局。',
  'row.poolOrderRuleId': '8. 账号 id。最终兜底，保证同样的池子每次排出来的顺序都一样。',
  'row.poolOrderWhy': '为什么临期积分压过手动顺序：临期积分是马上要过期的钱，而手动顺序可能已经过时、也可能是手滑拖错了。如果让手动顺序赢，一次误拖就足以让积分白白过期。所以有 3 天内到期积分的账号，永远排在没有的账号前面 —— 哪怕你把它拖到了最后一位。',
  'row.poolOrderBadgeNote': '徽标显示的是你「保存」的位置，不是此刻的实际排序。一个账号可能写着「第 2 位」却因为被限流而暂时不被选中 —— 那个数字代表你的偏好，池子会跳过当下无法扣费的账号。',
